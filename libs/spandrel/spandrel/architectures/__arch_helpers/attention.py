    Runs use scaled_dot_product_attention (cuDNN or memory-efficient attention), which
    takes bias and mask summed into one attn_mask. An ONNX export keeps the operations
    apart: TensorRT fuses them into its own attention kernel and adds bias and mask
    there, where their sum, (B*nW, heads, N, M), is a tensor as large as the attention
    matrix to write and read in every shifted block.

    Within migraphx_export, the mask, tiled over the images, instead selects between the
    scores and the scores plus the mask's value: the same values for a mask whose nonzero
    entries share one value, as HAT's and DAT's (-100) do. MIGraphX, compiling for one
    image, turns the view into an unsqueeze and a squeeze that its attention fusion does
    not walk through; and added to the scores directly, mask and bias are two constant
    terms, which MIGraphX sums into one constant as large as the scores.
